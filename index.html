<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <i>Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics</i> is a new series of research talks, highlighting the most exciting recent work in the international computer science logic community. The scope of the seminar series is roughly that of the major computer science logic conferences such as LICS, ICALP and FSCD. It takes place on most Wednesdays, with a focus every other week on the work of young researchers.</p>

<p>In this time of restricted international travel, a key aim of this series is to provide a forum for the informal discussion and social interaction that is so important for the progress of science. To facilitate this, the seminar incorporates in virtual form a number of features more normally associated with physical meetings:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Virtual "coffee breaks" before and after the seminar, allowing participants to chat in small groups, replicating the social element of a real-world conference.</li>
	<li>Robust technology platform supporting hundreds of interactive participants.</li>
	<li>Live-stream of the speaker's slides visible alongside the speaker's face, allowing nuanced communication at a human level.</li>
	<li>Chairperson to introduce the speaker, facilitate questions from the audience, and keep proceedings running on time.</li>
	<li>Audience members whose question is selected by the chairperson can deliver it in full audio and video, giving a natural interaction with the speaker.</li>
	<li>No need to register, just show up.</li>
</ul>

<p> Talks are given by invitation of the <a href="#sc">organizing committee</a>. Feedback is warmly encouraged; if you have any comments or ideas, feel free to get in touch with an organizer.</p>

<h2 id="mailing">Mailing list</h2>

<p>Seminars take place on Wednesdays at 2pm UTC. An easy way to see the corresponding time in your own time zone is to add the OWLS calendar to your own calendar, with the following links: <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=iigkhoapdthqfpibn42s761dlc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon">Google Calendar</a> <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/iigkhoapdthqfpibn42s761dlc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">Apple Calendar</a> </p>
<p>Seminars are 45 minutes long including questions, and will start at the advertised time. <a href="#coffeebreaks">As described below</a>, feel free to join early, or stay around after the end of the talk, to participate in the coffee breaks. A link to join the seminar is given in the <a href="#partinfo">participant information</a> below. Every other week, the seminar hosts a young researcher to present their work; these seminars are labelled OWLS-YR.</p>
<p>Here is the list of upcoming seminars. </p>

<ul>

	
<li>03 November 2021. Karoliina Lehtinen, Aix-Marseille University, "Good-for-games vs. history-determinism in quantitative automata
". <i>Chair : TBA</i>
                <span class="abstract">
                        <p>
                        Automata models between determinism and nondeterminism can retain some 
of the algorithmic properties of deterministic automata while enjoying 
some of the expressiveness and succinctness of nondeterminism. In the 
setting of regular languages two such models --  namely good-for-games 
automata and history-deterministic automata -- coincide, and have known 
applications in reactive synthesis.

In this talk, I discuss what happens when these notions are lifted to 
the quantitative setting. Perhaps surprisingly, the two automata models 
are no longer equivalent. This talk will explore the landscape of these 
automata classes and their applications to different quantitative 
synthesis problems.

<p>Here is the list of past seminars in reverse chronological order.</p>

<ul>
    <li>20 October 2021 (YR-OWLS). Thejaswini Raghavan, University of Warwick, "The Strahler Number of a Parity Game and more". <i>Chair : Charles Grellois</i>
        <span class="abstract">
            <p>
            Solving parity games has been of great interest due to its unique complexity status. In this talk, we will look at "The Strahler number of a Parity game" and argue that it is a robust, and hence arguably natural, parameter as it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures and—remarkably—with the register number defined by Lehtinen (2018). We show that parity games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices and linear in (d/2k)^k, where k is the Strahler number. One algorithm we obtain is by providing small Strahler Universal Trees.
Since most known techniques for solving parity games can be viewed as a search for winning sets for the players with the help of universal trees, it makes sense to build faster algorithms parametrised by these trees. We will explore some algorithms where these trees are explicitly taken as input, and we compare their advantages and disadvantages.
This talk is based primarily based on two works: 1) The Strahler Number of a Parity Game with Laure Daviaud and Marcin Jurdziński and 2) A Symmetric Attractor-Decomposition Lifting Algorithm for Parity Games with Marcin Jurdziński, Rémi Morvan and Pierre Ohlmann.

    </li>
		<li>13 October 2021 (OWLS). Quentin Carbonneaux and Peter O'Hearn, Facebook, "Applying proof to a microkernel IPC mechanism". <i>Chair : Alexandra Silva</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
			Facebook is building a new microkernel operating system as part of its AR/VR
strategy.  This talk describes a project to apply software verification to a
central part of the OS: the interpocess communication design.
We use Iris, an implementation of concurrent separation logic in the Coq 
proof assistant, to verify two queue data structures used for IPC.
The verification effort uncovered algorithmic simplifications as well as 
bugs in client code.  The simplifications involve the removal of redundant 
operations in a performance-critical part of the kernel. 
The proof work was completed in person months, not years, by engineers with 
no prior familiarity with Iris. These findings are spurring further use of 
verification at Facebook.

		<li>14 July 2021. No seminar as <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/">ACT 2021</a> is taking place.</li>


	<li>07 July 2021 (YR-OWLS). <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/clara-lacroce/">Clara Lacroce</a>, McGill University, "Optimal Spectral-Norm Approximate Minimization". <i>Chair : Nathanaël Fijalkow</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNW7S1L4cbg">(video)</a>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				I will present recent work in approximate minimization, done in collaboration with Borja Balle, Prakash Panangaden, Doina Precup and Guillaume Rabusseau. 

				We address the approximate minimization problem for weighted finite automata (WFAs) with weights in $\R$, over a one-letter alphabet: to compute the best possible approximation of a WFA given a bound on the number of states. This work is grounded in Adamyan-Arov-Krein approximation theory, a remarkable collection of results on the approximation of Hankel operators. In addition to its intrinsic mathematical relevance, this theory has proven to be very effective for model reduction. We adapt these results to the framework of weighted automata over a one-letter alphabet. We provide theoretical guarantees and bounds on the quality of the approximation in the spectral and $\ell^2$ norm. We develop an algorithm, based on the properties of Hankel operators, that returns the optimal approximation in the spectral norm.

				Then, we study the approximate minimization problem of black boxes trained for language modelling of sequential data over a one-letter alphabet.  We use the spectral norm to measure the distance between the black box and the WFA, and we provide theoretical guarantees to study the potentially infinite-rank Hankel matrix of the black box, without accessing the training data. Finally, we propose an algorithm returning an asymptotically-optimal approximation of the black box.

		<li>30 June 2021. No seminar as <a href="http://easyconferences.eu/lics2021/">LICS 2021</a> is taking place.</li>	


	<li>23 June 2021 (YR-OWLS). <a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/etienne.miquey/">Etienne Miquey</a>, ENS Lyon, "Evidenced Frames: A Unifying Framework Broadening Realizability Models". <i>Chair : Charles Grellois</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				Constructive foundations have for decades been built upon realizability models for higher-order logic and type theory. However, traditional realizability models have a rather limited notion of computation, which only supports non-termination and avoids many other commonly used effects. Work to address these limitations has typically overlaid structure on top of existing models, such as by using powersets to represent non-determinism, but kept the realizers themselves deterministic. On the other hand, the algebraic structure of existing realizability models taking into account effects in a more direct fashion (as is done in Krivine realizability for instance) is hard to analyze.
			</p>
			<p>	
				In this work, we (Liron Cohen, Ross Tate & myself) alternatively address these limitations by making the structure underlying realizability models more flexible. To this end, we introduce evidenced frames: a general-purpose framework for building realizability models that support diverse effectful computations. We demonstrate that this flexibility permits models wherein the realizers themselves can be effectful, such as λ-terms that can manipulate state, reduce non-deterministically, or fail entirely. Beyond the broader notions of computation, we demonstrate that evidenced frames form a unifying framework for (realizability) models of higher-order dependent predicate logic. In particular, we prove that evidenced frames are complete with respect to these models, and that the existing completeness construction for implicative algebras—another foundational framework for realizability—factors through our simpler construction. As such, we conclude that evidenced frames offer an ideal domain for unifying and broadening realizability models.

	<li>16 June 2021 (OWLS). <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~dallago/">Ugo Dal Lago</a>, University of Bologna "On Differential Program Semantics
		". <i>Chair: Jamie Vicary</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
			Traditionally, program semantics is centered around program equivalences and refinements, based on which verification and transformation techniques can be justified. More and more often, however, programs are substituted with approximately equivalent programs, or verified against imprecise specifications. Program semantics has started dealing with program differences only in recent years, through the interpretation of programs in metric spaces. We give a brief survey about the state of the art on metric program semantics, and on the inadequacy of metrics as a way to deal with program differences. We thus point at a few recent results on a new kind of differential program semantics in which differences are context-sensitive, thus richer in structure than mere numbers.</p>

	<li>09 June 2021 (YR-OWLS). <a href=" ">Adwait Godbole</a>, University of California at Berkeley, "Verification of Parameterized Release-Acquire". <i>Chair : Nathanaël Fijalkow</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				Memory consistency models provide semantics to memory accesses of multiprocessor programs, sequential Consistency (SC) being a well known example. Weak Memory Models (WMMs) are relaxations of SC which provide weaker guarantees but allow for improved performance. Verification of safety properties has been shown to be a very hard problem from a complexity standpoint for many WMMs. Hence abstractions of such systems and, frameworks providing approximate results are of interest.
				This talk is based on the safety verification problem for Release-Acquire (RA) semantics, a popular fragment of C++11 that balances performance and programmability. The focus will be on the role of parameterization, which allows a program to be executed by arbitrarily many (apriori unknown number of) threads. This  can be seen as a (conservative) over-approximation of actual system behaviour. I will talk about some general concepts, including a simplified semantics which we found to be useful in analysing parameterized RA systems. I will then discuss how one can refine the parameterized system with non-parameterized programs. The expressivity of allowed programs affects the hardness of the verification problem and I will talk about concrete algorithmic and complexity results for different program classes. To conclude I will give some extensions of these ideas to variant WMMs as well as avenues for future work.

	<li>02 June 2021 (OWLS). <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/~meena/">Meena Mahajan</a>,  IMSc, HBNI, Chennai, "Refuting false QBFs with Merge Resolution
		". <i>Chair : Pawel Sobocinski</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				Resolution is one of the most well-studied proof systems for proving
				classical propositional tautologies. It has naturally been the
				first-choice system to be built upon and generalised to obtain proof
				systems for quantified Boolean formulas QBFs. In this talk, I will
				briefly survey some resolution-based QBF proof system approaches, and
				then discuss the proof system MergeRes. This is the first QBF system
				where strategies are built into the proof, as opposed to being
				algorithmically extracted from them. I will describe how this
				approach, and the chosen way in MergeRes for representing the
				strategies, is double-edged: it gives MergeRes an exponential
				advantage over many resolution-based QBF proof systems while refuting
				certain formulas, but also leads to exponential lower bounds in
				MergeRes for some formulas that are easily refutable in other calculi.

	<li>26 May 2021 (YR-OWLS). <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/">Gabriel Scherer</a>, INRIA, "Normalization by realizability: a dependently typed pearl". <i>Chair: Charles Grellois</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				The work to be presented is in collaboration with Pierre-Évariste
				Dagand and Lionel Rieg. It studies the computational content of the
				Fundamental Lemma of classical realizability for the simply-typed
				lambda-calculus with sums.
			</p><p>
				(If you are unfamiliar with classical realizability, it might help to
				think of it as a unary logical relation with an elegant symmetric
				setup -- it originates in studies of classical logic. The talk will
				gently introduce classical realizability.)
			</p><p>
				Two salient points of our presentation correspond to folklore ideas
				that we present as opinionated recommandations, to ourselves and
				others, of how to give a "modern" presentation of these questions
				(classical realizability, and in general studying the computational
				content of a proof device):
			</p><p>
				1. We present classical realizablity as compilation to Curien-Herbelin
				style symmetric abstract machine calculi, instead of the Krivine
				Abstract machine, to represent realizers. Experts will recognize
				the polarized reduction rules of Munch-Maccagnoni.
			</p><p>
				2. To present computation content, we are *not* using extraction of
				a program from a mathematical-style proof in a proof
				assistant. That beautiful approach rarely works and it generates
				ugly code. Instead we *write* the logical argument directly as
				a program in a dependently-typed (meta)language, and we think about
				the code we are writing.

		". <i>Chair : Alexandra Silva</i>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				I will discuss how certain functions, e.g. string-to-string transducers, or tree-to-tree transducers, can be presented using primitives of functional programming languages, such as composition of functions, or monad operations on the underlying datatypes (lists or trees). If the primitives are chosen well, then we can get classes of functions known from automata theory, e.g. two-way automata as string-to-string transducers or monadic second-order transductions.

	<li>12 May 2021 (YR-OWLS). <a href="http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~mwaga/">Masaki Waga</a>, Kyoto University, "Online Quantitative Timed Pattern Matching with Semiring-Valued Weighted Automata". <i>Chair: Koko Muroya</i>
		<a href="slides/waga.pdf">(slides)</a>
		<span class="abstract">
			<p>
				Monitoring of a signal plays an essential role in the runtime verification of cyber-physical systems. Qualitative timed pattern matching is one of the mathematical formulations of monitoring, which gives a Boolean verdict for each sub-signal according to the satisfaction of the given specification. There are two orthogonal directions of extension of qualitative timed pattern matching. One direction on the result is quantitative: what users want is often not a qualitative verdict but the quantitative measurement of the satisfaction of the specification. The other direction on the algorithm is online checking: the monitor returns some verdicts before obtaining the entire signal, which enables to monitor a running system. In this talk, we talk about a combination of these two extensions taking an automata-based approach. This is the first quantitative and online timed pattern matching algorithm to the best of our knowledge. More specifically, we employ what we call timed symbolic weighted automata to specify quantitative specifications to be monitored, and we obtain an online algorithm using the shortest distance of a weighted variant of the zone graph and dynamic programming. Moreover, our problem setting is semiring-based and therefore, general. Our experimental results confirm the scalability of our algorithm for specifications with a time-bound.

			<p>Joint work with Chris Barrett and Victoria Barrett</p>
			<p>Subatomic proof systems in deep inference exploit the idea that atoms can be seen as superpositions of values, for example, true and false. Adopting this point of view leads to some dramatic simplifications of proof systems and their proof theory, and this talk provides an example.</p>
			<p>A single, simple, linear inference shape, together with a certain notion of saturation, generates a proof system for a language of standard boolean operators augmented by decision trees. We prove cut-elimination and several other proof-theoretic results for this proof system. Moreover, the proof system provides cut-free proofs of Statman tautologies that are polynomial in the size of the tautologies, while standard proof systems only yield exponential cut-free proofs. The ideas are natural, simple, and mostly rely on two notions that appear to have very general applicability: projecting proofs around atoms and eversion of formulae.</p>
			<p>I could summarise the philosophy behind deep inference and subatomic proof theory as follows. We expand the class of proofs to make accessible better proofs for richer languages and to simplify the normalisation theory. One main reason for its success is deep inference's unique ability to deal with self-dual non-commutative operators, which is what atoms are when used as decision tree constructors.</p>
			<p>The talk does not assume previous knowledge of deep inference and focuses on the general concepts rather than the technicalities. More information about deep inference is at <a href="http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/">http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/</a>.</p>

				Register automata are an extension of automata that deal with data,

				automata theory remain to work on deterministic register automata.
				However, the nondeterministic register automata are strictly more

				Motivated by a recent result that the subclass of unambiguous register
				automata has decidable equivalence, we investigate weighted register
				automata, the common generalisation of register automata and weighted
				automata. These include unambiguous register automata. We show that
				equivalence is also decidable for these automata. This improves the

				the complexity is exponentially better; and (c) we allow automata with

						Bertrand et al. introduced a model of parameterised systems, where each agent is represented by a finite state system, and studied the following control problem: for any number of agents, does there exist a controller able to bring all agents to a target state? They showed that the problem is decidable and EXPTIME-complete in the adversarial setting, and posed as an open problem the stochastic setting, where the agent is represented by a Markov decision process. In this paper, we show that the stochastic control problem is decidable.

				<span class="abstract">
					<p>
						While model checking has often been considered as a practical alternative to building formal proofs, we argue here that the theory of sequent calculus proofs can be used to provide an appealing foundation for model checking. Since the emphasis of model checking is on establishing the truth of a property in a model, we rely on the proof-theoretic notion of additive inference rules, since such rules allow provability to directly describe truth conditions. Unfortunately, the additive treatment of quantifiers requires inference rules to have infinite sets of premises and the additive treatment of model descriptions provides no natural notion of state exploration. By employing a focused proof system, it is possible to construct large-scale, synthetic rules that also qualify as additive but contain elements of multiplicative inference. These additive synthetic rules -- essentially rules built from the description of a model -- allow direct treatment of state exploration. This proof-theoretic framework provides a natural treatment of reachability and non-reachability problems, as well as tabled-deduction, bisimulation, and winning strategies.

					<p>Session types are a type-based approach for ensuring correct message-passing programs. A session type specifies the protocol that each channel endpoint in aprogram should respect.</p>
					<p>Session types have been originally developed for processes in the pi-calculus, the paradigmatic calculus of interaction and concurrency. While there is substantial value in studying session types for the pi-calculus, it is also insightful to investigate them for programming calculi with a more direct link with (functional) programming languages.
					To this end, we have studied a core calculus for higher-order concurrency and sessions, called HO. HO is a compact blend of sessions and higher-order concurrency, in which the values exchanged by processes can only be abstractions (functions from names to processes).</p>
					<p>In this talk, I will overview two results on the expressivity of HO processes with session types. They show how session types not only delineate and enable encodings; they inform the techniques required to reason about their correctness properties. First, HO and the session pi-calculus are equally expressible: one language can be encoded into the other, up to tight behavioral equivalences. Second, there is a class of so-called minimal session types, which only covers protocols without sequential composition but is still expressive enough to encode all typable HO processes.</p>

				<span class="abstract">
					<p>
						We present quantitative separation logic (QSL). In contrast to classical separation logic, QSL employs quantities which evaluate to real numbers instead of predicates which evaluate to Boolean values. The connectives of classical separation logic, separating conjunction and separating implication, are lifted from predicates to quantities.
						This extension is conservative: Both connectives are backward compatible to their classical analogs and obey the same laws, e.g. modus ponens, adjointness, etc.

						Furthermore, we present a weakest precondition calculus for quantitative reasoning about probabilistic pointer programs in QSL. This calculus is a conservative extension of both Ishtiaq's, O'Hearn's and Reynolds' separation logic for heap-manipulating programs and Kozen's / McIver and Morgan's weakest preexpectations for probabilistic programs. Our calculus preserves O'Hearn's frame rule, which enables local reasoning - a key principle of separation logic.

						Finally, we briefly touch upon open questions regarding lower bounds on weakest preexpectations and intensional completeness of our calculus.

				<span class="abstract">
					<p>
						Focusing is a general technique that was designed to improve proof search, but has since become increasingly relevant in structural proof theory. The essential idea is to identify and merge the non-deterministic choices in a proof. A focused proof is then given by the alternation of phases where invertible rules are applied eagerly (bottom-up) and phases where the other rules are confined and controlled. 

						The focusing theorem, which asserts the completeness of focused proofs, delivers strong representational benefits. For instance, by ignoring the internal structure of the phases one obtains a well-behaved notion of ‘synthetic rule’ (e.g. they commute with cut-reduction steps). 

						In this talk, we will present a careful study of a family of synthetic rules, the bipoles, giving a fresh view to an old problem: how to incorporate inference rules corresponding to axioms into proof systems for classical and intuitionistic logics. As different synthetic inference rules can be produced for the same axiom, we in fact unify and generalise previous approaches for transforming axioms into rules.

				<span class="abstract">
					<p>				
						While causal consistency is one of the most fundamental consistency models weaker than sequential consistency, the decidability of safety verification for (finite-state) concurrent programs running under causally consistent shared-memories is still unclear. We establish the decidability of this problem for two standard and well-studied variants of causal consistency. To do so, for each of the variants, we develop an equivalent "lossy" operational semantics, and show that it constitutes a well-structured transition system, which enables decidable verification. The two novel semantics are based on similar key observations, which, we believe, may also be of independent use in the investigation of weakly consistent shared memory models and their verification. Interestingly, our results are in contrast to the undecidability of this problem under the Release/Acquire fragment of the C/C++11 memory model, which forms another variant of a causally consistent memory that, in terms of allowed outcomes, lies strictly between the two models we study. Nevertheless, all these variants coincide for write/write-race-free programs, which implies the decidability of verification for such programs under Release/Acquire.

					<p>
						Church's synthesis problem asks whether a synchronous specification from infinite words to infinite words can be realized by a synchronous function. We relax this requirement and ask whether a synchronous specification from infinite words to infinite words can be realized by a computable function, in other words, we simply ask whether a specification is implementable.
						<br>
						This question has been previously studied by Holtmann et al. who showed that the problem is decidable (it was later shown to be EXPtime-complete) for synchronous specifications with total domain. We show that the question is EXPtime-complete for synchronous specifications with partial domain. A specification with partial domain is implementable if for every input sequence in its domain an output sequence can be computed that is correct w.r.t. the specification. A fundamental difference between the total and the partial domain setting is that, if the specification is implementable, in the former setting sequential transducers suffice to do so and in the latter setting a more powerful computation model is needed. We show that if a synchronous specification from infinite words to infinite words is implementable then a deterministic two-way transducer can compute an implementation.

						In both computer science and economics, efficiency is a cherished property. In computer science, the field of algorithms is almost solely focused on their efficiency.

				<span class="abstract">
					<p>Mainstream formal analyses of software systems focus on extensional properties of program behaviour. Such properties ultimately deal with the input/output semantics of programs, this way giving information on what programs compute. There are several situations, however, where intensional properties of programs turn out to be crucial to ensure the correct behaviour of software systems. In these scenarios, one needs not only to know what output a program computes, but also how the program computes it. Typical examples of intensional aspects of computations include efficiency, resource usage, robustness with respect to errors, and privacy and security.</p>
					<p>In the last decades, these properties have been studied in isolation by means of type systems, denotational semantics, and operational techniques. More recently, uniform accounts of a large family of intensional aspects of computations (oftentimes referred to as coeffectful computations) have been proposed in terms of graded modal types and graded (co)monads.</p>
					<p>In this talk, I will present a general framework for studying operationally-based notions of program equivalence for languages with graded modal types. These notions of equivalence identify programs with the same intensional behaviour and thus allow for the intensional analysis of programs. The framework will be instantiated to study the intensional refinement of Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity (a coinductively-defined notion of equivalence for higher-order sequential languages) giving an abstract compositionality theorem generalising well-known results on intensional program behaviour such as Abadi's et al. Non-interference, Pfenning's Proof Irrelevance, and Reed and Pierce's Metric Preservation.</p>
					<p>Finally, a formal connection between the theory of intensional program equivalence and the theory of abstract program distance built on top of Lawvere's analysis of generalised metric spaces will be established, this way allowing for the transfer of results and techniques developed in the context of program metric to the realm of intensional analyses of languages with modal types.</p>

						Roughly, a pMC is a Markov chain with symbolic transitions. The feasibility problem asks:
						Do values for the symbols exist such that in the induced parameter-free Markov chain, a target state is reached with probability at least a half.
						We discuss the complexity landscape for variants of this decision problem.
						In particular, we establish that feasibility in pMCs is complete for the complexity class "existential theory of the reals” (ETR).
						Another example of an ETR-complete problem is  deciding whether a multivariate polynomial has a real root.
						Together with the results of the first half of the talk,
					this establishes that deciding whether there exists a good memoryless policy in a POMDP is ETR-complete.</p>

					<p>Compositional methods are central to the development and verification
						of software systems. They allow to break down large systems into
						smaller components, while enabling reasoning about the behaviour of the
						composed system. For concurrent and communicating systems, compositional
						techniques based on *behavioural type systems* have received much
						attention. By abstracting communication protocols as types, these type
						systems can statically check that programs interact with channels
						according to a certain protocol, whether the intended messages are
						exchanged in a certain order. For this talk, we will put on our
						coalgebraic spectacles to investigate *session types*, a widely studied
						class of behavioral type systems. We will seek a syntax-free
						description of session-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. The
						result will be a description of type equivalence, duality, and subtyping
						relations in terms of canonical coinductive presentations. In turn,
						this coinductive presentation makes it possible to elegantly derive a
						decidable type system with subtyping for π-calculus processes, in which
						the states of a coalgebra will serve as channel protocols. Going full
						circle, we will also exhibit a coalgebra structure on an existing
						session type system, and show that the relations and type system

					<p>Joint work with <a href="https://danel.ahman.ee">Danel Ahman</a>, University of Ljubljana.</p>

					<p>In modern languages, computational effects are often structured using monads or algebraic effects and handlers. These mechanisms excel at implementation of computational effects within the language itself. For instance, the familiar implementation of mutable state in terms of state-passing functions requires no native state, and can be implemented either as a monad or using handlers. One is naturally drawn to using these techniques also for dealing with actual effects, such as manipulation of native memory and access to hardware. These are represented inside the language as algebraic operations or a monad, but treated specially by the language's top-level runtime, which invokes corresponding operating system functionality. While this approach works in practice, one wishes that the ingenuity of the language implementors were better supported by a more flexible methodology with a sound theoretical footing.</p>
					<p>We address the issue by showing how to design a programming language based on runners of algebraic effects. We review runners, recast them as a programming construct, and present a calculus that captures the core ideas of programming with them. Through examples of runners we show how they capture both the interaction between the program and the external world, and encapsulation of programs in virtual environments that tightly control access to external resources and provide strong guarantees of proper resource finalization.</p>

					In this talk we will introduce a new property of formal languages called REG-measurability where REG is the class of regular languages.
					Intuitively, a language L is REG-measurable if there exists an infinite sequence of regular languages that ``converges'' to L.
					A language without REG-measurability has a complex shape in some sense so that it can not be approximated by regular languages.
					<br>
					The motivation, why we have been interested in REG-measurability, originally came from the following conjecture posed by [Dömösi-Horvath-Ito 1991]:
					the set of all primitive words over a non-singleton alphabet is not context-free.
					<br>
					We will describe that several context-free languages are REG-measurable (including languages with transcendental generating function and transcendental density, in particular),
					while a certain simple deterministic context-free language and the set of primitive words are REG-immeasurable in a strong sense.

				<span class="abstract">
					Cyclic proof theory is an increasingly popular tool for (co)inductive reasoning in algebras, type systems, modal fixed point logics and predicate logics with inductive definitions. Understanding the relative power of cyclicity and induction constitutes one of the key questions traversing these areas.

					The setting of first-order arithmetic provides us with well understood delineations of proof theoretic expressivity, namely in terms of *logical complexity*, i.e. the number of quantifier alternations required for formulas occurring in a proof. We show that cyclic proofs in arithmetic are strictly more succinct than inductive ones in this sense, refining a recent result that cyclic arithmetic and Peano arithmetic are equivalent [Simpson '17] cf. also [Berardi & Tatsuta '17]. We give a converse result too, thus classifying the proof theoretic strength of cyclic arithmetic theories with restricted logical complexity. The former result is based on structural proof theoretic techniques, namely a form of cut-elimination, while the latter result requires us to adapt recent results on the reverse mathematics of omega-word automaton theory [Kołodziejczyk, Michalewski, Pradic & Skrzypczak '16]  with classical proof theoretic methods.

					Given the uniformity of our approach, we are able to recover a metamathematical account of our cyclic theories too. As a result we partially resolve an open problem on the logical strength of McNaughton's theorem on determinisation of omega-word automata from [Kołodziejczyk, Michalewski, Pradic & Skrzypczak '16], by reduction to a form of Gödel incompleteness for cyclic theories.

				<span class="abstract">
					Various kinds of relational algebras have been studied since long time. The traditional approach consists in giving an algebraic theory, namely a signature and a set of equations. Unfortunately, the equations often turn out to be incomplete, unless one uses more sophisticated logics (e.g, Horn clauses).
					In this talk, we advocate the use of a different sort of algebra, where terms are not anymore trees but rather graphs. This has a clear categorical justification that can be clearly expressed by mean of functorial semantics by Lawvere.  We start by gently introducing the Lawvere's approach and then explain its relational extension to Cartesian Bicategories by Carboni and Walters.

				<span class=abstract>
					<p>
						The entire community is invited to participate in a debate on the future of the conference system in theoretical computer science. This will provide a rare community-wide opportunity for us to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our current system, and consider if we can do better. Questions will be asked by members of the audience, and answered by our panel members.
					</p>
					<p>
						The scope of the debate is all aspects of our publishing and community
						traditions, characterised by prestige earned mostly through
						publication in competitive conferences, and frequent local and
						international travel. Possible topics for discussion include the need
						to publish in conferences for career progression, which usually
						involves burning carbon; wasted reviewing effort when good papers are
						rejected from highly competitive conferences; the extent of our
						responsibility as a community to respond to climate change;
						alternative publishing models, like the journal-focussed system used
						in mathematics; high costs of conference travel and registration;
						virtual conference advantages, disadvantages and best practice;
						improving equality, diversity and access; consequences and response to
						COVID-19; and the role of professional bodies. These topics have many
						tight relationships, and need to be discussed together to gain a full
						understanding of the issues involved.
					</p>
					<p><b>Poll responses.</b> Here are the results of the three anonymous polls that were held during the debate.
						<ol>
							<li>
								Until recently, it was common for members of the TCS community to make regular flights. If COVID-19 can be resolved soon with a widely-available vaccine, should we try as a community to:
								<ul>
									<li>go back to our usual flight habits (i.e. flying several times per year) <i>(2 responses, 3%)</i></li>
									<li>continue regular flights, but at a substantially reduced frequency (i.e. flying a couple of times per year) <i>(58 responses, 73%)</i></li>
									<li>almost completely eliminate flights (i.e. flying a few times per career) <i>(19 responses, 24%)</i></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Most researchers in TCS follow the "conference first" model, in which results are published first in a conference (either physical or virtual, and preferably high-status), and later on in a journal in expanded form. As a community, should we aim to:
								<ul>
									<li>continue this into the future <i>(43 responses, 32%)</i></li>
									<li>switch to a "journal first" model more like mathematics, changing the TCS conference system so presentation of a paper does not imply publication in an associated proceedings volume <i>(91 responses, 68%)</i></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								For the purposes of professional networking and scholarly communication in TCS, virtual conferences can be:
								<ul>
									<li>just as effective as physical conferences, or even more effective <i>(28 responses, 20%)</i></li>
									<li>less effective than physical conferences, but still reasonably effective <i>(67 responses, 47%)</i></li>
									<li>much less effective than physical conferences <i>(48 responses, 34%)</i></li>

				<a href="slides/grumberg.pdf">(slides)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/sXU0DONk-4M">(video)</a> 
				<span class=abstract>In the process of software development and maintenance, much efforts are invested in order to
					ensure that the product is as bug free as possible. Automating the repair process is highly
					desired.
					In this talk we present two approaches to automated program repair, based on formal methods.
					The first approach automatically repairs an erroneous program
					using a predefined set of mutations to the code (e.g., replacing ‘+’ with ‘-‘ ; ‘&gt;’ with ‘&lt;’, etc.).
					The repair algorithm goes through generate-validate iterations, which involve fault localization
					mechanism in order to disregard sets of unsuccessful repairs.
					The approach guarantees soundness and completeness with respect to a bounded notion of
					correctness.
					The second approach intertwines compositional Assume-Guarantee verification with repair.
					Automata learning is used for compositional verification. If an erroneous behavior is found,
					abduction assists in repairing the system by inferring new constraints that eliminate erroneous
					runs. Then, the verification proceeds for the repaired system.

				<span class="abstract">
					In the mid 80s, Lichtenstein, Pnueli, and Zuck proved a normal form for
					formulas of LTL with past operators, which Manna and Pnueli then used as the
					basis of their famous classification of temporal formulas. Some years later,
					Chang, Manna, and Pnueli built on this result to derive a similar normal form for
					the future fragment of LTL. Both normalisation procedures had a non-elementary
					worst-case blow-up, and followed an involved path from LTL formulas to counter-free
					automata to star-free regular expressions and back to LTL.<br><br>
					We improve on both points. We present a purely syntactic normalisation procedure
					from LTL to LTL, with single exponential blow-up, that can be implemented in a few
					dozen lines of Standard ML code. As an application, we derive a simple algorithm to
					translate LTL into deterministic Rabin automata. The algorithm normalises the
					formula, translates it into a special very weak alternating automaton, and applies a
					simple determinisation procedure, valid only for these special automata.<br><br>

				<a href="slides/umang.pdf">(slides)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/UP5dp1thzj4">(video)</a>
				<span class="abstract">
					Uninterpreted programs are sequential programs with loops and recursion written over a first order vocabulary where the constant, function and predicate symbols used are completely uninterpreted. The input to an uninterpreted program is a first order structure which also determines the semantics of such a programs. The verification question in this setting asks if an uninterpreted a program meets all its assertions on all input structures. In this talk, I will discuss the decidability boundaries for the verification question of uninterpreted programs. In general, the problem is undecidable, but becomes decidable for a sub-class, called coherent uninterpreted programs. The decidability result is tight in that slightly relaxing the coherence criteria leads to undecidability.
					I will then discuss how the decidability result of coherent programs segue into more general classes of programs, called k-coherent programs (k is a natural number). Finally, I will discuss extensions to the verification question for partially interpreted programs, where the vocabulary is associated with an underlying first order theory and the inputs are those first order structures which are also models of this underlying theory.

				<span class="abstract">
					Probabilistic independence is a useful concept for describing the result of random sampling---a basic operation in all probabilistic languages---and for reasoning about groups of random variables. Nevertheless, existing verification methods handle independence poorly, if at all. We propose a probabilistic separation logic PSL, where separation models probabilistic independence, based on a new, probabilistic model of the logic of bunched implications (BI). The program logic PSL is capable of verifying information-theoretic security of cryptographic constructions for several well-known tasks, including private information retrieval, oblivious transfer, secure multi-party addition, and simple oblivious RAM, while reasoning purely in terms of independence and uniformity. If time permits, we will also discuss ongoing work for reasoning about conditional independence.

				<span class="abstract">
					A functional program is said to be linear when it uses exactly once its
					input. Linearity is useful to handle memory safely, single-use channels
					in concurrency, or quantum resources. Yet, we do not want all inputs to
					be linear and some of them can be used several times safely. Hence the
					need to understand what is a model of linear-non-linear substitution.
					Such settings appear naturally in differential lambda-calculus which is
					our initial motivation.

					We move from the usual categorical axiomatization of linear logic and
					lambda-calculus to the multicategorical axiomatisation, using
					profunctors and 2 monads to give account to linear and non-linear
					contexts. We present how to combine the linear and the non-linear 2

Using the framework of quantitative algebras, recently introduced by Mardare, Panangaden, and Plotkin, we derive an equational presentation of this monad on metric spaces.

				<a href="slides/fortin.pdf">(slides)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/GLjukqOA5to">(video)</a> 
				<span class="abstract">
					It is well-known that linear orders have the 3-variable property, meaning that over linear orders, every monadic first-order formula with up to 3 free variables is equivalent to one that uses at most 3 variables in total. Over the years, this has been extended to richer classes of structures, such as real-time signals with the +1 relation, Mazurkiewicz traces, or message sequence charts. In this talk, I will present a unifying proof that generalizes those facts. It is based on star-free PDL, a variant of propositional dynamic logic that captures precisely the 3-variable fragment of first-order logic. More precisely, I will show that over structures consisting of one linear order and arbitrarily many binary relations satisfying some monotonicity conditions, star-free PDL has the same expressive power as full first-order logic. This implies that any class of such structures has the 3-variable property.

					Parikh's theorem (1961) connects two basic concepts in computer science,

					and order). This theorem has become a standard tool in the theory of

					In this talk, we will recall Parikh's theorem and look at it from the

				<span class="abstract">
					Program termination is a key question in program verification. This talk considers the termination of probabilistic programs, programs that can describe randomised algorithms and more recently received attention in machine learning. Probabilistic termination has several nuances and has some unexpected effects. Programs may diverge with zero probability; they almost-surely terminate (AST). Two AST-programs run in sequence may have an infinite expected run-time, though each of its constituents has a finite expected run-time.
					This talk will demystify the notions of probabilistic termination, its surprising effects, and its hardness ("degree of undecidability"). We will show a simple proof rule for deciding AST.

				<span class="abstract">
					Homotopy type theory (HoTT) is a foundation for mathematics. Its origins are in work of Awodey, Warren and independently Voevodsky, an algebraic geometer who then changed area and proposed a new definition of equality between mathematical objects. Voevodsky was initially motivated by a desire to formally verify his own work on a computer. However after his unfortunate death in 2017 it was still not the case that any serious algebraic geometry recognisable to a classical algebraic geometer had been formalised in a HoTT computer system. Even in 2020 Grothendieck's original definition of a scheme (the fundamental building block of modern algebraic geometry) has only been formalised in Lean's Dependent Type Theory (DTT), and not in any HoTT system.

					In my talk, I will start by explaining Voevodsky's univalence axiom, the problems it solves and the problems it causes. I will then explain a basic mathematical question for which Voevodsky's axiom seems in theory like it might be helpful. I will finally talk about work of Ramon Fernandez Mir on formalising Grothendieck's original definition of a scheme in Lean's DTT system (without Voevodsky's axiom). Whether or not this can be done in a HoTT system is apparently an open problem, but one which is easily attackable, and I will finish by explaining my plan for attacking it.

		<h2 id="partinfo">Information for participants</h2>

		<p><i>Joining the seminar.</i> To join any OWLS seminar, visit the following link, up to 15 minutes before the posted start time:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/177472153?pwd=MFgwd0EzY05QSGtpSDc2dU16aG9wdz09">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/177472153?pwd=MFgwd0EzY05QSGtpSDc2dU16aG9wdz09</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You will be given the option to join through your web browser, or to launch the <i>Zoom</i> client if it is installed on your device <a href="#technology">(see below)</a>. For the best experience, we recommend using the client. When prompted for your name, please enter your real name, so that social interactions during the seminar and coffee breaks can be more natural.
		</p>

		<p><i>Audio and video.</i> We encourage all participants to enable their audio and video at all times (click "Use Device Audio" in the <i>Zoom</i> interface.) Don't worry about making noise and disrupting the proceedings accidentally; the Chairperson will ensure your audio is muted by default during the seminar. Having your audio and video enabled will allow other participants to see your face in the "Gallery" view, letting them know that you're taking part. It also gives you the option of asking a question, and of making best use of the "coffee break" sessions. For most users with good network access (such as a fast home broadband connection), there is no need to worry that having your audio and video enabled will degrade the experience; the technology platform ensures that the speaker's audio/video stream is prioritised at all times. However, those on slow connections may find it better to disable their audio and video.
		</p>

		<p id="coffeebreaks"><i>Coffee breaks.</i> Every OWLS seminar has two "coffee breaks", one starting 15 minutes before the posted start time of the seminar, and the second starting after the seminar is finished. To participate in these, feel free to join the meeting early, or to keep the meeting window open after the end of the talk. During these coffee break periods, participants will be automatically gathered into small groups, assigned at random; please introduce yourself to the other members of your group, and chat just like you would at a real conference. Remember to bring your own coffee! If you're not interested in chatting, please close the meeting window during the coffee break periods, so that people who want to chat are not grouped with those who do not.
		</p>

		<p><i>During the seminar.</i> If you'd like to ask a question, either during the seminar or in the question period at the end, click the "Participants" menu and select "Raise hand". The Chairperson may choose to interrupt the speaker and give your audio/video feed the focus, giving you the opportunity to ask your question verbally, or may instead decide to let the seminar continue. You may click "Lower hand" at any time to show you no longer wish to ask a question. To preserve the experience of a real face-to-face conference, there is no possibility of giving a written question, and the chat room is disabled. You also have the opportunity to give nonverbal feedback to the speaker by clicking the "speed up" or "slow down" buttons, also in the "Participants" menu.
		</p>

		<p><i>Recordings.</i> Most OWLS seminars will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube after the event. Only the audio/video of the chairperson, speaker, and questioners will be captured. If you prefer not to be recorded, do not ask a question. Of course, the organizers do not make any recordings of the coffee break sessions.
		</p>

		<p><i>Inappropriate behaviour.</i> The organizers make use of a range of security features to ensure that the seminar cannot be disrupted by participants who are not interested in constructive scientific interaction. During a seminar, if you observe ongoing inappropriate behaviour, please send a private message to the chairperson to point it out.
