     <p>The <i>Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics</i> is a new series of fortnightly research talks, highlighting the most exciting recent work in the international computer science logic community. The scope of the seminar series is roughly that of the major computer science logic conferences, such as LICS, ICALP and FSCD.</p>

     <p>In this time of restricted international travel, a key aim of this series is to provide a forum for informal discussion and social interaction that is so important for the progress of science. To facilitate this, the seminar incorporates in virtual form a number of features more normally associated with physical meetings:
     </p>
     <ul>
     	<li>Virtual "coffee breaks" before and after the seminar, allowing participants to chat in small groups, replicating the social element of a real-world conference.</li>
     	<li>Robust technology platform supporting hundreds of interactive participants.</li>
     	<li>Live-stream of the speaker's slides in-set with the speaker's face, allowing nuanced communication at a human level.</li>
     	<li>Chairperson to introduce the speaker, facilitate questions from the audience, and keep proceedings running on time.</li>
     	<li>Aggregate nonverbal feedback from audience members, such as "go faster" or "slow down", reported in real-time to the speaker.</li>
     	<li>Audience members whose question is selected by the chairperson can deliver it in full audio and video, giving a natural interaction with the speaker.</li>
     	<li>No need to register, just show up.</li>
     </ul>

     <p> Talks are given by invitation of the <a href="#sc">steering committee</a>. Feedback is warmly encouraged; if you have any comments or ideas, feel free to get in touch with a steering committee member.</p>

     <h2>Information for participants</h2>

     <p><i>Joining the seminar.</i> To join any OWLS seminar, visit the following link, up to 15 minutes before the posted start time:</p>
     <ul><li><a href="https://zoom.us/j/177472153">https://zoom.us/j/177472153</a></li></ul>
     <p>You will be given the option to join through your web browser, or to launch the <i>Zoom</i> client if it is installed on your device <a href="#technology">(see below)</a>. For the best experience, we recommend using the client.</p>

     <p><i>Audio and video.</i> We encourage all participants to enable their audio and video at all times (click "Use Device Audio" in the <i>Zoom</i> interface.) Don't worry about making noise and disrupting the proceedings accidentally; the Chairperson will ensure your audio is muted by default during the seminar. Having your audio and video enabled will allow other participants to see your face in the "Gallery" view, letting them know that you're taking part. It also gives you the option of asking a question, and of making best use of the "coffee break" sessions. For most users with good network access (such as a fast home broadband connection), there is no need to worry that having your audio and video enabled will degrade the experience; the technology platform ensures that the speaker's audio/video stream is prioritised at all times. However, those on slow connections may find it better to disable their audio and video.</p>

     <p id="coffeebreaks"><i>Coffee breaks.</i> Every OWLS seminar has two "coffee breaks", one starting 15 minutes before the posted start time of the seminar, and the second starting after the seminar is finished. To participate in these, feel free to join the meeting early, or to keep the meeting window open after the end of the talk. During these coffee break periods, participants will be automatically gathered into small groups, assigned at random; please introduce yourself to the other members of your group, and chat just like you would at a real conference. Remember to bring your own coffee!</p>

     <p><i>During the seminar.</i> If you'd like to ask a question, either during the seminar or in the question period at the end, click the "Participants" menu and select "Raise hand". The Chairperson may choose to interrupt the speaker and give your audio/video feed the focus, giving you the opportunity to ask your question verbally, or may instead decide to let the seminar continue. You may click "Lower hand" at any time to show you no longer wish to ask a question. To preserve the experience of a real face-to-face conference, there is no possibility of giving a written question, and the chat room is disabled at all times. You also have the opportunity to give nonverbal feedback to the speaker by clicking the "speed up" or "slow down" buttons, also in the "Participants" menu.</p>

     <p><i>Recordings.</i> All OWLS seminars are recorded and uploaded to YouTube after the event. Only the audio/video of the chairperson, speaker, and questioners will be captured. If you prefer not to be recorded, do not ask a question. Of course, the organizers do not make any recordings of the coffee break sessions.</p>

     <h2 id="upcoming">Upcoming seminars</h2>

     <p>Here is the list of upcoming seminars. Click on a seminar to see an abstract and for a download link to the slides.</p>
	<p>Seminars take place fortnightly on Wednesdays at 2pm UK time. Note that before the first talk the UK will move to Daylight Savings Time, which is UTC+1. An easy way to see the corresponding time in your own time zone is to add the OWLS calendar to your own calendar, by clicking the button in the bottom-right of the schedule. Viewing your calendar will then show the OWLS talks at the correct time in your own time zone.</p>
     <p>Seminars are 45 minutes long including questions, and will start at the advertised time. <a href="#coffeebreaks">As described above</a>, feel free to join early, or stay around after the end of the talk, to participate in the coffee breaks.</p>
